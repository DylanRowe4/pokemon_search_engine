# Pokemon Pokedex Search Engine
Combining the whoosh and streamlit packages to create a Pokedex search engine for all the different regions. This allows the user to search any pokemon, view all their stats, moves, evolutions, etc as well as a separate tab that contains all of their evolutions pages as well. Not for commercial use, just a fun side project for a game my brothers and I were playing. An example of the interface can be seen below.
